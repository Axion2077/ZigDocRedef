# Redefining Zig Documententation
As the title may suggest, this project is me redefining the terms used in Zig's Documentation.
Note that, I am not actually changing the Zig Documentation, this is simply me interpretating what is written in the socumentation.

# Why
This project is mainly due to my own lack of understanding of zig. 
And I intend to solve that understanding by attempting to understand what is said in the Zig documentation. 
Then explaining that information as simply as possible, to ensure that I understand it.

# Precautions
I am in no way capable of going through everything in the Zig documentation, do not expect me to be even remotely close to defining everything that is in there.
Also, as previously mentioned, I have a very lacking understanding of zig, anything that I write could be wrong.
At the end of the day, this project is more for me than anyone else, if you want to use it, that is fine.
